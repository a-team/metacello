### Metacello

Metacello is a package and dependency management solution for different
Smalltalks, including Squeak, Pharo and Gemstone/S. While Metacello
Configurations solve the problem of Monticello keeping track of Monticello
packages, their dependencies and their installation peculiarities on different
platforms, the Metacello packages themselves are scattered all over different
SqueakSource servers, and sometimes the steps to install them (even though
they are fewer than with Monticello only) are not always clear.

We build this in order to provide a community service similar to RubyGems to
the Smalltalk community, with a central directory of available projects, with
short descriptions and references to their repositories, as well as some
information about the compatibility between different Smalltalks.
